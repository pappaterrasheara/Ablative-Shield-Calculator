# Ablative-Shield-Calculator
Calculates the heat shield thickness and ablation rate needed to protect spacecraft during atmospheric re-entry. This Python tool estimates thermal protection requirements based on re-entry velocity, heat flux, and material propertiesâ€”helpful for aerospace students and engineers designing ablative shields.
